##  Part 1: Regression — Student Performance Dataset

**Objective**: Predict students' math scores using machine learning regression techniques.

###  Techniques Used:
- Multilinear Regression
- Polynomial Regression (Degree 2)

###  Key Steps:
- Data Loading & Cleaning
- One-Hot Encoding of Categorical Variables
- Feature Selection & Polynomial Feature Engineering
- Model Training (80/20 Split)
- Evaluation: RMSE, MAE, R² Score
- Visualization: Predicted vs Actual
- Discussion on Overfitting/Underfitting

##  Part 2: Classification — Social Network Ads Dataset

**Objective**: Predict whether a user will purchase a product based on age and salary using classification models.

###  Models Implemented:
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (k = 3, 5, 7)
- Decision Tree (Gini & Entropy)

###  Key Steps:
- Data Preprocessing & Standardization
- Label Encoding
- Model Training (75/25 Split)
- Evaluation:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix
- Optional: Decision Boundary Visualization
- Final Model Comparison
